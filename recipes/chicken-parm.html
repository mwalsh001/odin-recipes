        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper (for seasoning)</li>
                    <li>All-purpose flour (for dredging)</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>Bread crumbs (preferably Italian seasoned)</li>
                    <li>Cooking oil (for frying)</li>
                    <li>Marinara sauce</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
                    <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
                    <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them gently with a meat mallet or rolling pin until they are evenly flattened to about ½ inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Set up three shallow bowls or dishes. Fill one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with bread crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, coating both sides and shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, press the chicken into the bread crumbs, ensuring it is evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Heat a generous amount of cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, carefully place the breaded chicken breasts into the pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and place them on a baking sheet or dish. Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast, covering them completely.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauce-covered chicken breasts.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the baking sheet or dish to the preheated oven and bake for approximately 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Once the chicken Parmesan is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired, before serving.</li>
                    <li>Serve the chicken Parmesan hot with a side of pasta or a crusty bread roll, and enjoy the delicious flavors!</li>
