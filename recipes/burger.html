        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ground beef (80/20 blend is recommended)</li>
                    <li>Brioche buns (or your preferred burger buns)</li>
                    <li>Sharp cheddar cheese slices</li>
                    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>Dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
                    <li>Tomato slices</li>
                    <li>Pickles</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper (for seasoning)</li>
                    <li>Cooking oil (for grilling the patties)</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, season the ground beef with salt and pepper to taste. Gently mix the seasoning into the meat, being careful not to overwork it.</li>
                    <li>Divide the seasoned beef into equal portions and shape them into patties slightly larger than the size of your buns, as they will shrink during cooking.</li>
                    <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill or pan and cook for approximately 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
                    <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the bun. Slice the brioche buns in half and lightly toast them on the grill or in a toaster until they are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and Dijon mustard to create a tangy spread.</li>
                    <li>Once the patties are cooked to your liking, place a slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top of each patty. Allow it to melt slightly from the residual heat.</li>
                    <li>Spread the mayo-mustard mixture on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the cheeseburgers by placing a patty with melted cheese on top of the spread.</li>
                    <li>Top the patty with lettuce leaves, tomato slices, and a few pickles.</li>
                    <li>Finally, place the top half of the bun on the assembled burger.</li>
                    <li>Serve the cheeseburgers immediately while they are still warm and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
